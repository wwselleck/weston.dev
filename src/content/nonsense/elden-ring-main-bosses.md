title: Elden Ring Main Boss Rankings

1. **Godrick**\
Not as difficult as I remembered from my first playthrough, but more difficult than Margit by a small margin.
1. **Margit the Fell Omen**\
I had a much harder time with Margit on my first playthrough, but this time he wasn't too bad. Maybe the Reduvia Dagger I'm using is particular good against him? Either way, still a fun fight.
