title: Sleeping Pokemon Cards 
---

I want to catalogue and collect every Pokemon card featuring a sleeping Pokemon.

1. The art on the card must feature a Pokemon that is sleeping.
2. The sleeping Pokemon in the art does _not_ have to be Pokemon whose card the art is on. e.g., if a sleeping Bulbasaur is in the background of a Pikachu card, that still counts.
3. Sleeping human characters or non-Pokemon animals do not count
