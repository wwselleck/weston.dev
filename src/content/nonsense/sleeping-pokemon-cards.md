title: Sleeping Pokemon Cards 
---

I want to catalogue and collect every Pokemon card featuring a sleeping Pokemon.

1. The art on the card must feature a Pokemon that is sleeping.
2. The sleeping Pokemon in the art does _not_ have to be Pokemon whose card the art is on. e.g., if a sleeping Bulbasaur is in the background of a Pikachu card, that still counts.
3. Sleeping human characters or non-Pokemon animals do not count


## How do you know if a Pokemon is sleeping?

Well, that's a good question. If a Pokemon has its eyes closed, is in a position where it could reasonably fall asleep, and appears to be motionless, then it'll usually be safe to assume it's sleeping. There are definitely going to be some ambigious cases, though, and I'll just have to make a judgement on those as I find them. 

Take for example, Snorlax. Snorlax is always depicted with its eyes closed; in fact, I'm not sure if Snorlax canonically even has eyes. It's also usually (but not always) lying down. In this first card, Snorlax is clearly sleeping, and this card qualifies for the list.

In this card, Snorlax is lying down with its eyes closed, but is clearly not asleep.

But in _this_ card, things get tricky. Snorlax is lying against a tree with its eyes closed, but it's also smiling, blushing, and the Pokemon around it are clearly awake. I don't think I can definitively say either way that Snorlax is or isn't sleeping here. ![](https://static.tcgcollector.com/content/images/4c/cb/4e/4ccb4e53509b32434cc467ab4c68317a4c9c6dafd80f0162a142b0fb195f2bab.jpg)

> And in case you noticed the "Sleeping Pokemon" text on the card, this doesn't actually mean that Snorlax is sleeping. "Sleeping Pokemon" is just its category, this same text shows on cards where Snorlax is clearly not sleeping.
