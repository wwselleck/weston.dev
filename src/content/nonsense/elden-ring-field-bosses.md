title: Elden Ring Field Boss Rankings
---

1. **Ancient Hero of Zamor** (Weeping Evergaol)\
Felt like a good amount of difficulty for where they're placed, and overall just a fair and fun moveset to learn.
1. **Deathbird** (Warmaster's Shack)\
Very cool design, but not too difficult once you kite them away from the trolls.
1. **Tree Sentinel** (Limgrave)\
Great music
1. **Night's Cavalry** (Weeping Peninsula)\
Pretty easy if you fight on the horse and just whack them whenever they're doing doing their 3-swing move, but still pretty fun.
1. **Erdtree Avatar**\
I know you end up fighting a bunch of these, but this first one is pretty fun. Their hitbox when you're standing right in front of them is a bit weird, but otherwise a pretty standard, good fight.
1. **Runebear**
1. **Tibia Mariner** (Summonwater Village)
1. **Mad Pumpkin Head** (Waypoint Ruins)
1. **Scaly Misbegotten**\
The dungeon they're in is more difficult than the actual boss.
1. **Black Knife Assassin** (Limgrave)
1. **Erdtree Burial Watchdog** (Impaler's Catacombs)\
I created this page solely so I could put this piece of shit in last. Maybe I made this too hard on myself by using the Reduiva Blood Dagger and getting here at a lower level, but this took me at least 30 attempts. The main boss on its own is kind of annoying; its attacks are hard to time, its overhead sword attack seems to magically snap onto you no matter where you are relative to the boss, and it's also a repeat boss. But in addition, they throw in 4 of the **WORST** enemies I've ever seen in a game: [Imps](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Imp). I try to not use summons when fighting FromSoftware bosses, but I had to use the wolves summon for this one. Bad...bad...really bad.`,
