# Pickling Eggs

A [restaurant in Austin](https://www.haymakeraustin.com/) has habanero pickled eggs on the menu, and let me tell you they are _yummy_. So I want to start pickling eggs myself, and I'm going to document my progress here.

## Batch #1

So to start this off, I wanted to learn how to boil eggs effectively. I have attempted to boil eggs in the past, but it's never gone very well, and I usually only end up with 2 or 3 decent eggs out of a dozen.

I looked up "boiling eggs" on Youtube and found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CnAQzEiuvQ) video. The steps they outline are...

```md
1. Bring a pot of water to a boil (enough water to cover the eggs plus an inch or so).

2. Remove the eggs from the fridge so they have a chance to warm up a bit while the water is boiling.
```

```
- 6 Eggs
