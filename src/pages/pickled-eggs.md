# Pickling Eggs

A [restaurant in Austin](https://www.haymakeraustin.com/) has habanero pickled eggs on the menu, and let me tell you they are _yummy_. So I want to start pickling eggs myself, and I'm going to document my progress here.

## Batch #1

So to start this off, I wanted to learn how to boil eggs effectively. I have attempted to boil eggs in the past, but it's never gone very well, and I usually only end up with 2 or 3 decent eggs out of a dozen.

I looked up "boiling eggs" on Youtube and found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CnAQzEiuvQ) video. The steps they outline are...

```md
1. Bring a pot of water to a boil (enough water to cover the eggs plus an inch or so).

2. Remove the eggs from the fridge so they have a chance to warm up a bit while the water is boiling.

3. Once the water is boiling, lower the heat to low, and gently put each egg into the water (using a ladle or similar).

4. Turn the heat back up, and cook for some number of minutes depending on how cooked you want the eggs

- 6 minutes: Runny yolk, mostly cooked whites
- 8 minutes: Slightly runny yolk, cooked whites
- 10 minutes: Soft yolk
- 12 minutes: Mostly cooked yolk, still a tiny bit of softness
- 14 minutes: Fully cooekd yolk


5. While the eggs are cooking, prepare a bowl ice/water to place the eggs into once they're finished cooking. This will cool them down quickly so they stop cooking.

6. Once the eggs have been in the ice water for a few minutes, peel them while running under cold water. Crack the wider end of the egg to get started.
```

For pickled eggs, it seemed like 12 minutes was appropriate for cook time. Everything went well untli the peeling step, when I realized that my eggs were _very_ undercooked; the whites of the egg were still very translucent and just fell apart as soon as I broke through the shell.

After consulting with my girlfriend, it seemed as if the issue was my inaccuracy in judging when the pot of water was boiling. I thought that the water was "boiling" once you started to see the first bubbles rise, but apparently it's not until the bubbles are rising rapidly. Oops.

So, I re-heated the water to an _actual_ boil, and dropped the remaining eggs back in for a few more minutes. The second peeling attempt went better, but I still only had about a 50% success rate with getting pickling-suitable eggs. They were all cooked fully, but I butchered 5 of them during the peeling process.

For the remaining 6, I started my pickle brine...

```
1. Combine 1/2 cup white vinegar, 1/2 cup water, ~tsp salt, ~tbsp sugar, and peppercorns in a saucepan, and heat until boiling, stirring frequently.

2. Let boil for a few minutes, and then take off heat.

3. Let cool for a few minutes because you're paranoid about the hot liquid breaking your glass jars.
```

For 6 eggs packed into a standard mason jar, this pickling brine recipe resulted in just a little less liquid than I needed; the top egg or two in the jar weren't fully covered.

### After 24 hours

- Vinegar Intensity: ⭐ (out of 5)
- Other Flavor intensity: 0 (out of 5)
- Egg quality: ⭐ (out of 5)
- Overall: ⭐⭐ (out of 5)

These eggs were good, but didn't taste substantially different from just a regular boiled egg. The vinegar taste wasn't very strong, and the eggs were probably a bit overcooked from my "not knowing what boiling means" issue. There also wasn't much of a salty taste.

### After 48 hours

- Vinegar Intensity: ⭐⭐
- Other Flavor Intensity: ⭐
- Egg quality: ⭐
- Overall: ⭐⭐

The vinegar was a bit more noticeable after an extra 24 hours, but not enough to bump up the overall rating.

This is only picture I got of this batch, since I didn't decide to write anything about this until this point.
