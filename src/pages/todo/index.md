This is my to-do list for this website.

- [ ] Add a fun animation to the "weston.dev" header text
- [ ] Create tidbits index page
  - [ ] Allow filtering by tags
- [ ] Improve syntax highlights for markdown code blocks
- [ ] BUG: When first clicking on the homepage snack, the emoji snaps tothe bottom right of the cursor.
- [ ] Use colors that compliment each other (i.e. establish a palette). Right now, the colors were just picked by what looked nice in my opinion.
- [ ] Write post about how the website is written
- [ ] Automatically generate markdown TOC based on frontmatter setting
- [x] Separate lists, programming posts, and other posts on homepage (Done 6/4/2023)
- [x] Remove "lists" concept, just make the video games list a regular page like anything else (Done 6/4/2023)
- [x] Add tidbits to homepage (Done 6/3/2023)
