title: Contiguous vs. linked data structures
published: true

In [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.algorist.com/), the chapter on data structures starts off with the author defining what they consider to be two categories of data structures: contiguous and linked. Contiguous data structures are those that are composed of single chunks of memory, while linked structures are those that contain multiple chunks of data that are tied together via pointers.

I found this interesting because in all of my college courses and in any book or article I've read about computer science, I've never heard this distinction so explicitly called out as a foundational way to categorize data structures. It's probably not all that controversial of a statement, but I don't feel like any of my learnings up until now have emphasized this distinction in the way that this book did by it basically being the first words said about data structures.
